Express Note Taker

## Description
The following app contained previously made starter code front end. I provided the back end to make the note taker functional. The app uses express routes and middleware from the node modules to make the app functional. A UUID module is used to create a unique ID with each note in order to enable the delete function later.

## Deployed app
The app is deployed in heroku
